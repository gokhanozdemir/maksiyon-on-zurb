# M-Aksiyon Task

During this project my general attitude was to minify the distraction, divisions and data feed. 

Esspecially the header area for the apps general info removed.

By moving the keywords selection to upwards and near the data sets, to which it is related, the data flow is made mode easy to grasp.

For the app general info another modal + card design is generated.

Open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.
